### Discovery Cloud

This was made as a stop-gap replaceent for discovery swarm.

https://github.com/mafintosh/discovery-swarm

We were developing on a platform (Chrome App) that had some serious network
bugs and platform limitations and while waiting for the issues surriounding
discovery swarm to get fixed built this as a replacement.  This is the server
portion of the project that will allow peers to find each other via disvoery
keys and get piped websockets to each other created.
